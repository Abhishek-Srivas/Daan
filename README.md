# Project : Daan

# Inspiration :

In these hard times of Covid, our country is trying its best to fight against it. And a lot of Organizations, NGOs, and Self Help Groups are trying their best to help as many people as they can, especially those who are from slums and are so poor that they canâ€™t even afford to bring food to themselves.
But these organizations also face problems like
To collect or find different volunteers
People who want to donate food, clothing, water, etc. to the slums and poor people.
Raise Money for the poor people.
A lot of these organizations used to educate the children but education has also been compromised.

# What it does :

We aim to provide a web app in which NGOs and Self Help groups can register and launch a campaign.
The campaign can be given different tags i.e
education,
health,
food or
Money Raise, etc.

Then they have to add the details about the Camping ex:- for whom they are doing the campaign and what is their goal.
In the Dashboard, they can see their campaigns and the donations to them.

People can come to the web app and can see the upcoming and ongoing campaigns in their city. And can donate the money or contact the NGO and Self help groups if they want to volunteer or give some other items like food, clothes, books to the NGO/SHG.

# How we built it

The frontend was implemented in react.js, using Figma for design and layout, and Axios to consume the backend.
The backend was developed in node.js and express.js. Using some middlewares like jwt, to generate tokens, cors to enable the external ports for the frontend. And we keep the information in a NoSQL database, MongoDB.
